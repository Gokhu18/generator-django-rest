# generator-django-rest [![npm](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-django-rest.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/generator-django-rest) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metakermit/generator-django-rest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metakermit/generator-django-rest) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metakermit/generator-django-rest/master/LICENSE) [![Updates](https://pyup.io/repos/github/metakermit/generator-django-rest/shield.svg)](https://pyup.io/repos/github/metakermit/generator-django-rest/)

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for easily bootstrapping a Django REST API
with some common settings and quickly deployable to Heroku/Dokku.
Check out this quick screencast showing you how to deploy a full-fledged
Django REST API to Heroku in 5 minutes:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/290704.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/290704)

The goal is to keep you efficient and include features you
need in a typical modern web app, yet keeps things simple and not too bloated.
You can see an example generated Django project [here][hellodjangorest].

*Note: the project is still considered to be in beta until I get a chance
to test it on more apps. That said, I am using it in my own projects :)*

## Features

Some of the cool features that come with generator-django-rest are:

* üöÄ quick to launch ‚Äì start a new project and deploy it to [Heroku][]
  in 3 commands:
  
  ```shell
  yo django-rest
  ./scripts/install.sh
  ./scripts/deploy.sh
  ```

* ‚ö°Ô∏è productive ‚Äì start the Django, DB & optionally frontend dev servers easily

  ```shell
  ./scripts/start.sh
  ```

* üê≥ Docker support ‚Äì get a complete environment with Django, Postgres & Redis in a single command:

  ```shell
  docker-compose up
  ```

* ü¶Ñ modern JS ‚Äì serve static files on _/_ using [django-spa][] for
  [nice single-page apps][spa-frontend-on-heroku] using React / Angular / Vue‚Ä¶
* ‚öõÔ∏è GraphQL ‚Äì interactive API with filtering and nested queries using [Graphene](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/)
* ‚õµÔ∏è monorepo - option to automatically set up a [create-react-app][]
  frontend for you in the same git repo with everything integrated under the mantra
  _one app, one repo, one dyno_
* üì¶ Heroku-friendly packaging ‚Äì if you're using the built-in React frontend,
  `deploy.sh` minifies the frontend and packages it up with Django
  into a separate prod branch ready for deployment as a Django web app
  (that gets deployed to [Heroku][] by default)
* üç£ Dokku support ‚Äì quick to deploy to [Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku), a DIY alternative to Heroku
* ü§ì [12-factor][] config ‚Äì environment variable configuration using [django-environ](https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ)

  * define a variable in _.env_ for dev e.g. `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0`
  * use it in _settings.py_, e.g. `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = env('REDIS_URL')`
  * set variables on the prod server (just works‚Ñ¢ with Redis on [Heroku][])

* üîã batteries included

  * [Celery][] with a Redis backend ‚Äì cause you'll need an async task queue
  * [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html)
    media file storage backend (optional)

* üìú sane logging ‚Äì defaults to
  [fail nicely](https://github.com/metakermit/fail-nicely-django)
* üê∂ familiar ‚Äì check out the rough
  [project file layout](generators/app/templates/django/mysite),
  it's much like `django-admin startproject myproject` would set it up
  (only repeats the project name twice,
  i.e. _~/code/myproject/myproject/settigns.py_). An example generated app is
  published as [metakermit/hellodjango][hellodjangorest].

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for a full release history with all the
features.

## Getting Started

To begin, you need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
Once you have that, you need Yeoman pre-installed. Yeoman lives in the
[npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him
once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive.

```shell
npm install -g yo
```

Then, we need the django-rest generator, i.e. plug-in. You install
generator-django-rest from
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-django-rest).

```shell
npm install -g generator-django-rest
```

Finally, for every new project you would initiate the generator
in an empty folder.

```shell
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
yo django-rest
```

Now check the _HACKING.md_ file in the generated code project for
extra instructions (generated from [this template](https://github.com/metakermit/generator-django-rest/blob/master/generators/app/templates/django/mysite/HACKING.md) if you're curious).

## Contributing

If you have some ideas for contributions, suggestions are always welcome.
Note, however, that the goal of the project is to stay minimalist,
so we'll try to keep the number of dependencies small.

As a reminder to myself, I release a new version of generator-django-rest by running:

```shell
npm run release:patch # or :minor or :major
npm publish
```
